# Beast Badges

### A trophy case for every Beast holder. On-chain, permanent, earned not bought.

---

## The Idea

You log into the AKCB Portal. Next to your profile and B*Points, there's a new section — your badge wall:

> **Ape Gang** — you hold an Ape balaclava.
> **Blackout** — your beast has 5 black traits, head to toe.
> **Diamond Hands** — you've held for 6 months and never sold.
> **Full Mech** — your beast is wearing a complete Robot Suit.
> **Angel Wings** — you hold one of 9 Angel DNA beasts.
> **Cowboy** — your beast has Cowboy Hat + Cowboy Boots. Only 4 exist.

Your XP total: 1,240. **Gold Tier.** Only 12 holders have more.

You jump into Beastside. Your Gold Tier badge is visible in the lobby. Mid-match, you win with your Cowboy beast — "Cowboy Showdown" badge unlocks in real time.

Later in Discord, someone types `/badges` and sees your collection. They think: "They have Face Collector? That means they hold all four premium balaclavas. I only need Wolf to get there."

That's Beast Badges. A permanent, on-chain achievement system that lives on your portal profile, connects to the game, and shows up in Discord. It recognizes what this community already does — collecting specific traits, assembling clean fits, stacking beasts, holding through bear markets, and playing the game.

---

## How This Fits with B*Points

Beast Badges don't replace B*Points. They do different things.

**B*Points** = a currency. You earn them by holding over time. You spend them on raffles and rigged models. They're the paycheck.

**Beast Badges** = a trophy case. You earn them by doing specific things. You never spend them. They're permanent proof.

The two systems strengthen each other:
- Earning a badge could grant a B*Points multiplier
- Certain raffles could require a specific badge to enter
- Badge tiers could unlock higher B*Points earning rates
- Badges display on your portal profile alongside your points

## Data Validation

Every badge below has been validated against the complete dataset: all 10,000 Genesis Beast tokens with full trait data, 38,153 historic sales records spanning January 2023 to January 2026, 1,793 unique trait variants, and 10,748 unique buyer wallets. No badge listed here is impossible to earn. Token supply numbers are exact counts from the data, not estimates. Wallet-level qualifying counts are from an on-chain snapshot taken on 2026-02-11 (3,057 current holders across all 10,000 tokens via Alchemy).

---

## XP & Tier System

Every badge earns XP. Total XP determines your tier.

### Tier Thresholds

| Tier | XP Range | Distribution | What It Could Unlock |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bronze** | 0-299 | ~45% of holders | Badge holder recognition, basic Discord role |
| **Silver** | 300-699 | ~43% of holders | Enhanced Discord role, B*Points bonus multiplier |
| **Gold** | 700-1,299 | ~8% of holders | Exclusive raffles, early access to drops |
| **Diamond** | 1,300+ | ~4% of holders | Governance input, top-tier perks |

**XP by badge tier:** Common = 25, Uncommon = 75, Rare = 175, Epic = 325, Legendary = 750.

**Distribution validated against 3,053 current holders (on-chain snapshot, February 2026).** Silver tier (300-699 XP) represents the engaged collector segment — holders with 3-10 beasts who participate in market activity and have trait diversity. This creates natural trading demand as Bronze holders work toward Silver, and Silver holders compete to break into Gold.

### Category-Capped XP Model

Raw badge XP is capped per category to prevent inflation and reward breadth:

| Category | Cap | Category | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Balaclava Identity** | 400 XP | **DNA/Rares** | 400 XP |
| **Rare Styles** | 300 XP | **Neighborhoods** | 300 XP |
| **Color Coordination** | 200 XP | **Collection Milestones** | 300 XP |
| **Suits & Outfits** | 250 XP | **Market Behavior** | 400 XP |
| **Accessories & Gear** | 250 XP | **Cross-Collection** | 200 XP |
| **Community & IRL** | 200 XP | **Beastside Game** | 300 XP |
| **Seasonal** | 200 XP | **Unconventional Trader** | 300 XP |
| **Taste & Curation** | 250 XP | | |

**Max possible XP:** 4,250 (earning all 15 category caps). **Current earnable max:** ~2,800 (Phase 1), ~3,400 (Phase 2 with all categories).

**Why caps?** Adding new badges to one category doesn't inflate everyone's tier. A whale who maxed Balaclava Identity (400 XP) gets no benefit from 10 new balaclava badges — they're already capped. New badges help newer holders catch up, not inflate veteran scores.

Reaching Diamond (1,300+ XP) requires maxing 4-5 high-cap categories. No single path gets you there — this rewards the most complete ecosystem participants.

The badge library grows over time. New badges added for new Beastside maps, seasonal events, community-proposed ideas, new collections, and IRL events.

---

## Tier Thresholds

Badge tiers are based on how many tokens qualify (for trait-based badges) or how many wallets qualify (for wallet-level badges).

| Tier | Token-Based Threshold | Wallet-Based Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **Common** | 300+ tokens | Majority of holders qualify |
| **Uncommon** | 100-299 tokens | Requires specific traits or moderate collecting |
| **Rare** | 30-99 tokens | Notably selective |
| **Epic** | 10-29 tokens | Hard to achieve |
| **Legendary** | 1-9 tokens | Ultra-rare |

Some badges are manually tiered where the criteria warrants it (e.g., Knight's Watch at 40 tokens is Epic because Medieval is one of the "premium 4" balaclavas, not just a regular face).

---

## Badge Types: Achievement vs Status

All badges are **non-transferable** (can't be sold), but they fall into two categories with different permanence rules:

### 🏆 Achievement Badges (Permanent Soulbound)

**Orange frame.** These recognize historical milestones — things you did in the past that can't be undone.

**Rules:**
- Mint once, stay forever
- Can never be revoked or removed
- XP counts toward your total permanently
- Proof of past commitment

**Examples:** OG Holder, Diamond Hands, Good Flip, Floor Sweeper, Sleeper Hit, Event attendance

### ⚡ Status Badges (Revocable)

**Blue frame.** These reflect your current holdings and collection state.

**Rules:**
- Auto-mint weekly when you qualify
- Auto-revoke weekly when you no longer qualify (sell the trait/beast)
- XP counts only while badge is active
- Proof of current commitment

**Examples:** Ape Gang, Pack Leader, Face Collector, Blackout, all trait-based badges

### Why This Hybrid Model?

**Prevents farm-and-dump:** Can't buy 100 beasts, earn all badges, sell everything, and keep benefits. Status badges revoke when you sell.

**Preserves achievements:** Historical milestones (OG Holder, Diamond Hands) stay permanent — you earned them.

**Honest leaderboard:** Your badge wall and XP total reflect what you currently hold + what you've historically achieved.

**Dynamic competition:** Active collectors with 20 beasts can compete with (and surpass) inactive whales who sold down to 5.

### Weekly Snapshots

Every Monday at 00:00 UTC:
- System reads all wallet holdings
- Status badges auto-mint for newly qualifying wallets
- Status badges auto-revoke for wallets that sold qualifying assets
- Achievement badges never touched (immutable once earned)
- XP totals recalculate, tiers update

**Batched execution = minimal gas costs shared across all holders.**

## Retroactive Issuance & Eligibility

**Gate requirement:** Any wallet that currently holds at least 1 AKCB ecosystem NFT (Genesis Beast, BitBeast, Physical Edition, Hommage, or BeastMart) is eligible for badges.

### How Eligibility Works

| Badge Category | Qualification Rules | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Achievement** (permanent) | Retroactive — if you did it historically and still hold ≥1 ecosystem asset, you qualify | OG Holder: Bought before July 2023 and still holds any AKCB NFT |
| **Status** (revocable) | Current snapshot — must hold qualifying asset NOW | Ape Gang: Must currently hold a beast with Ape balaclava |

**Key scenarios:**

✅ **Scaled down holder:** Once had 50 beasts, now holds 5
- Gets: All Achievement badges from history (OG Holder, Good Flip, etc.)
- Gets: Status badges for current 5 beasts only
- Lost: Status badges from the 45 they sold

✅ **Returning holder:** Sold everything in 2024, bought back 1 BitBeast in 2026
- Gets: All Achievement badges from Genesis history unlocked
- Gets: Current Status badges for holdings
- Barrier to re-entry: Just 1 BitBeast (~$10) to restore full badge history

❌ **Full exit:** Sold everything across all collections
- Gets: Nothing (no ecosystem holding = no badge eligibility)

✅ **BitBeast-only collector:** Never owned Genesis, only BitBeast
- Gets: Achievement/Status badges from BitBeast holdings
- Cross-collection badges require Genesis + BitBeast

### Why This Approach

- **Rewards loyalty** — current holders get recognized for their full history
- **No wasted mints** — zero gas spent on dead wallets, bots, or exchange addresses
- **Subtle hold incentive** — lapsed holders with any ecosystem piece have a reason not to sell that last one
- **Low barrier to re-entry** — someone priced out of Genesis can buy a BitBeast and unlock their full badge history
- **Re-engagement hook** — "you hold 2 beasts but you've earned 15 badges you haven't seen yet"
- **No community resentment** — people who dumped and left don't get the same recognition as those who stayed
- **Consistent with soulbound philosophy** — badges prove you achieved something AND that you're still part of the ecosystem

## Tier Benefits & Anti-Gaming

Your badge wall shows your earned tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond) based on total XP. **BUT** certain tier benefits require minimum holdings to prevent farm-and-dump exploitation.

### Tier Benefits Require Minimum Holdings

| Tier | Badge Wall Status | To Receive Tier Benefits* |
|---|---|---|
| **Bronze** | Shows always if earned | Hold 1+ AKCB asset |
| **Silver** | Shows always if earned | Hold 3+ Genesis OR 10+ BitBeast |
| **Gold** | Shows always if earned | Hold 10+ Genesis OR 30+ BitBeast |
| **Diamond** | Shows always if earned | Hold 25+ Genesis OR 75+ BitBeast |

**\*Tier benefits = B*Points multipliers, exclusive raffles, governance input, etc.**

**Example:**
- Whale earns Diamond tier (2,600 XP, 80 badges)
- Sells down to 5 Genesis beasts
- Badge wall: Still shows "Diamond Tier" with all 80 badges (social flex intact)
- B*Points multiplier: Gets Silver benefits (1.5x) because only holds 5 beasts
- Raffle access: Silver-tier raffles, not Diamond
- If re-buys to 25: Diamond benefits automatically restore

### What This Prevents

❌ **Farm-and-dump:** Buy 100 beasts → earn Diamond → sell 95 → keep 3.0x multiplier
❌ **Capital rotation:** Use same capital to farm badges across multiple wallets
❌ **Inactive whales:** Collect all badges, exit ecosystem, keep permanent advantage

✅ **What it preserves:** Social status, achievement history, trophy case permanence

### B*Points Integration

**Current B*Points system:**
- Genesis: 10 pts/day base
- BitBeast: 1 pt/day base
- Royalty bonus: +5 pts/day per Genesis with royalties paid

**Proposed badge-driven system:**

| Component | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Base rate** | Unchanged (10/day Genesis, 1/day BitBeast) |
| **Tier multiplier** | Bronze 1.25x, Silver 1.5x, Gold 2.0x, Diamond 3.0x |
| **Royalty badge** | "Royalty Supporter" badge (auto-award for any royalty-paid purchase) grants +5 pts/day per Genesis |

**Example calculations:**

**Bronze holder:** 3 Genesis, no royalty badge
- Base: 3 × 10 = 30/day
- Bronze multiplier: 30 × 1.25 = 37.5/day

**Silver holder:** 5 Genesis, Royalty badge
- Base: 5 × 10 = 50/day
- Silver multiplier: 50 × 1.5 = 75/day
- Royalty bonus: 5 × 5 = +25/day
- **Total: 100 pts/day**

**Diamond holder:** 25 Genesis, Royalty badge
- Base: 25 × 10 = 250/day
- Diamond multiplier: 250 × 3.0 = 750/day
- Royalty bonus: 25 × 5 = +125/day
- **Total: 875 pts/day**

**Impact:** Engaged Diamond collectors earn ~12x more than passive Bronze holders (875 vs 37.5). Current system: 5x max (75 vs 15).

### Anti-Gaming Protections

| Attack Vector | Protection | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **Wash trading** | 30-day hold requirement + gas costs | Market behavior badges require 30-day hold before qualification. Gas + fees make wash trading uneconomical for non-monetary badges. |
| **Multi-wallet farming** | Math doesn't favor it | 1 wallet with 100 beasts earns more than 10 wallets with 10 each due to tier multiplier curve. |
| **Temporary qualification** | Status badges revoke | Buy Ape balaclava → claim badge → sell → badge burns next Monday. |
| **Cross-wallet badge shopping** | Weekly snapshots | Can't hold trait Monday, transfer Tuesday, claim badge Wednesday. Snapshot checks holdings at qualification time. |
| **Artist self-minting** | Smart contract enforcement | Artists can't mint their own designed badges. Badges only mint to wallets that meet qualification criteria. |
| **Floor manipulation** | Percentile-based floor | Floor badges use 10th percentile price + 10% buffer, not literal floor price. Hard to manipulate. |
| **Trait speculation** | Purchase timestamp cap | "Sleeper Hit" badge requires buying BEFORE trait pumped AND owning <15% of supply (prevents carpet-bomb buying). |

## Mint Fee Model

**Each badge costs to mint.** Revenue split:
- **50% to badge artist** (ongoing royalty for their design work)
- **50% to community infrastructure** (covers hosting, gas, development, operations)

### Tiered Pricing by Badge Rarity

| Badge Tier | Mint Fee | Artist Gets | Infrastructure Gets |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Common** | $0.25 | $0.125 | $0.125 |
| **Uncommon** | $0.50 | $0.25 | $0.25 |
| **Rare** | $1.00 | $0.50 | $0.50 |
| **Epic** | $2.00 | $1.00 | $1.00 |
| **Legendary** | $5.00 | $2.50 | $2.50 |

**Average collector cost (20 badges at launch):**
- 8 Common ($2) + 6 Uncommon ($3) + 4 Rare ($4) + 2 Epic ($4) = **~$13 total**

**Active collector over time (50 badges):**
- 15 Common ($3.75) + 18 Uncommon ($9) + 10 Rare ($10) + 5 Epic ($10) + 2 Legendary ($10) = **~$43 total**

**Why tiered pricing works:**
- Common badges stay accessible (quarter per badge)
- Legendary badges feel premium ($5 = meaningful)
- Artists earn meaningful revenue (Legendary design with 100 mints = $250)
- Community infrastructure funded sustainably

**Status badge re-minting:** If you earn a Status badge, sell the trait, then re-buy the trait later, you must pay the mint fee again (incentivizes holding).

## Why Base

- Physical Edition 1 is already on Base — ecosystem consistency
- ~$0.01 per mint vs $5-50 on Ethereum mainnet
- Coinbase ecosystem for easy onboarding
- Fast finality for real-time game badge minting

## What It Takes to Build

### Cost

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Contract deployment (Base) | < $5 | One-time |
| Minting all badges for all holders | < $50/year | ~$0.01 per mint, batched weekly |
| Alchemy API (read wallet holdings) | Free tier | Existing AKCB setup likely covers it |
| Server hosting | ~$10/month | Small API server, could share existing infra |
| Badge artwork | Variable | See below |
| **Total ongoing** | **~$15/month** | Not including artwork |

The main cost decision is artwork:

| Approach | Cost | Quality |
|---|---|---|
| AI-generated + manual polish | Near zero | Medium — good enough for launch |
| Community art contest | Prize budget only | Variable — great engagement opportunity |
| Artist-commissioned | $50-200 per badge | High — on-brand, professional |
| Rafsby/team designed | Team time | Highest — native to the AKCB art style |

Recommendation: Launch with AI-generated art for the first 20 and run a community design contest alongside. Final polish by the team's artist when ready.

### Who Builds It

This proposal is the system design. The team decides how it gets built.

**Option A: Team builds it.** The team takes this design, builds it in-house, and controls everything end-to-end. Smart contract, minting keys, and admin access all stay internal. Most secure, full control.

**Option B: Community contribution.** I contribute code as open-source. The team reviews, audits, and deploys. All contract ownership, minting keys, and admin access remain with the team. I have no privileged access — just a contributor submitting code for review.

**Option C: Collaborative.** We build together. I handle the eligibility engine and API logic, the team handles contract deployment, key management, and portal integration. All sensitive operations (minting, admin attestation) stay team-controlled.

**Regardless of approach, the team should always:**
- Deploy and own the smart contract
- Control the minter wallet private key
- Control admin attestation authority
- Review any code before it touches mainnet
- Have the ability to pause or upgrade without depending on anyone outside the team

The technical stack is straightforward — standard ERC-721, basic API server, Alchemy wallet reads. The hard part is the badge definitions and artwork. This proposal handles the definitions.

### Phases

**Phase 1 — Launch set** (20 badges, no game integration needed)
Deploy contract to Base. Eligibility engine reads Genesis/BitBeast/Physical Edition holdings. Badge wall goes live on the portal. Community goes live.

**Phase 2 — Full library + Beastside**
Add remaining trait badges, market behavior badges, community badges with admin attestation, cross-collection depth. B*Points integration. Beastside sends achievement events — game badges create the collecting-to-gaming loop.

**Phase 3 — Discord + automation**
`/badges` command in Discord for quick lookups. Webhook announcements for new badge unlocks. Weekly sweep auto-mints newly earned badges.

**Phase 4 — Ecosystem expansion**
Bisuto integration when it launches. Community badge proposals. Seasonal badges. XP tier perks. TGE snapshot readiness.

## Known Limitations

Being honest about what this system can and can't do:

**Badges are permanent, but holdings change.** You could earn Face Collector by holding all 4 premium balaclavas, then sell 3 and keep the badge. This is intentional — badges prove you *achieved* something, not that you *still have* it. Same model as Xbox achievements and Steam badges. The community will self-police obvious gaming.

**Multi-wallet problem.** If you hold Genesis on wallet A and BitBeast on wallet B, you won't earn Dual Citizen. Wallet linking (sign from both wallets to prove ownership) can solve this and could integrate with the portal's existing wallet connection.

**Market badges have limits.** Floor Sweeper can only be verified going forward since historical floor prices aren't stored. Some market badges are technically gameable through wash trading, but gas costs and marketplace fees are natural deterrents for badges that carry no monetary value.

**Community badges need clear criteria.** Admin-attested badges require someone to decide who qualifies. Criteria should be as objective as possible — "posted GM for 30 consecutive days" is verifiable from Discord logs, "consistently active" is subjective.

## Questions for the Team

1. **Does this fit the vision?** Is a soulbound achievement layer something that makes sense for where AKCB is heading?
2. **Badge definitions**: Do these feel right for the community? What's missing, what's off?
3. **Artwork**: Community contest, commissioned, team-designed, or start with AI?
4. **B*Points integration**: Connect from day one, or launch independently and add hooks later?
5. **Portal integration**: What's the best way to add a badge wall to existing portal profiles?
6. **Beastside timeline**: When could the game send achievement events?
7. **Admin attestation**: Who verifies community/IRL badges — core team only, or trusted mods?
8. **Badge governance**: Can the community propose new badges, or team-controlled?
9. **Physical Edition**: Auto-qualify from holding the NFT, or require additional verification?
10. **Interest level**: Is this worth pursuing? What's the next step?
