# Beast Badges

### A trophy case for every Beast holder. On-chain, permanent, earned not bought.

---

## The Idea

You log into the AKCB Portal. Next to your profile and B*Points, there's a new section — your badge wall:

> **Ape Gang** — you hold an Ape balaclava.
> **Blackout** — your beast has 5 black traits, head to toe.
> **Diamond Hands** — you've held for 6 months and never sold.
> **Full Mech** — your beast is wearing a complete Robot Suit.
> **Angel Wings** — you hold one of 9 Angel DNA beasts.
> **Cowboy** — your beast has Cowboy Hat + Cowboy Boots. Only 4 exist.

Your XP total: 1,240. **Gold Tier.** Only 12 holders have more.

You jump into Beastside. Your Gold Tier badge is visible in the lobby. Mid-match, you win with your Cowboy beast — "Cowboy Showdown" badge unlocks in real time.

Later in Discord, someone types `/badges` and sees your collection. They think: "They have Face Collector? That means they hold all four premium balaclavas. I only need Wolf to get there."

That's Beast Badges. A permanent, on-chain achievement system that lives on your portal profile, connects to the game, and shows up in Discord. It recognizes what this community already does — collecting specific traits, assembling clean fits, stacking beasts, holding through bear markets, and playing the game.

---

## How This Fits with B*Points

Beast Badges don't replace B*Points. They do different things.

**B*Points** = a currency. You earn them by holding over time. You spend them on raffles and rigged models. They're the paycheck.

**Beast Badges** = a trophy case. You earn them by doing specific things. You never spend them. They're permanent proof.

The two systems strengthen each other:
- Earning a badge could grant a B*Points multiplier
- Certain raffles could require a specific badge to enter
- Badge tiers could unlock higher B*Points earning rates
- Badges display on your portal profile alongside your points

---

## XP & Tier System

Every badge earns XP. Total XP determines your tier.

| Tier | XP | What It Could Unlock |
|---|---|---|
| **Bronze** | 0-249 | Badge holder recognition, basic Discord role |
| **Silver** | 250-749 | Enhanced Discord role, B*Points bonus multiplier |
| **Gold** | 750-1499 | Exclusive raffles, early access to drops |
| **Diamond** | 1500+ | Governance input, top-tier perks |

**XP by badge tier:** Common = 25, Uncommon = 50-100, Rare = 150-200, Epic = 250-400, Legendary = 500-1000.

Reaching Diamond requires depth across multiple categories. No single path gets you there — this rewards the most complete ecosystem participants.

The badge library grows over time. New badges added for new Beastside maps, seasonal events, community-proposed ideas, new collections, and IRL events.

---

## Tier Thresholds

Badge tiers are based on how many tokens qualify (for trait-based badges) or how many wallets qualify (for wallet-level badges).

| Tier | Token-Based Threshold | Wallet-Based Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **Common** | 300+ tokens | Majority of holders qualify |
| **Uncommon** | 100-299 tokens | Requires specific traits or moderate collecting |
| **Rare** | 30-99 tokens | Notably selective |
| **Epic** | 10-29 tokens | Hard to achieve |
| **Legendary** | 1-9 tokens | Ultra-rare |

Some badges are manually tiered where the criteria warrants it (e.g., Knight's Watch at 40 tokens is Epic because Medieval is one of the "premium 4" balaclavas, not just a regular face).

---

## Why Soulbound

Badges that can be traded stop being proof of anything. You could just buy "Diamond Hands" on OpenSea.

Soulbound means:
- **Earned, not bought** — the badge is proof you did the thing
- **Identity, not speculation** — your badges ARE your AKCB identity
- **Fair** — whales earn more through holding, but many badges reward behavior anyone can do (First Beast, GM Beast, Floor Sweeper)
- **TGE-ready** — if a token ever launches, XP from soulbound badges is a credibly fair allocation method that can't be gamed through secondary markets

---

## Why Base

- Physical Edition 1 is already on Base — ecosystem consistency
- ~$0.01 per mint vs $5-50 on Ethereum mainnet
- Coinbase ecosystem for easy onboarding
- Fast finality for real-time game badge minting

---

## What It Takes to Build

### Cost

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Contract deployment (Base) | < $5 | One-time |
| Minting all badges for all holders | < $50/year | ~$0.01 per mint, batched weekly |
| Alchemy API (read wallet holdings) | Free tier | Existing AKCB setup likely covers it |
| Server hosting | ~$10/month | Small API server, could share existing infra |
| Badge artwork | Variable | See below |
| **Total ongoing** | **~$15/month** | Not including artwork |

The main cost decision is artwork:

| Approach | Cost | Quality |
|---|---|---|
| AI-generated + manual polish | Near zero | Medium — good enough for launch |
| Community art contest | Prize budget only | Variable — great engagement opportunity |
| Artist-commissioned | $50-200 per badge | High — on-brand, professional |
| Rafsby/team designed | Team time | Highest — native to the AKCB art style |

Recommendation: Launch with AI-generated art for the first 20 and run a community design contest alongside. Final polish by the team's artist when ready.

### Who Builds It

This proposal is the system design. The team decides how it gets built.

**Option A: Team builds it.** The team takes this design, builds it in-house, and controls everything end-to-end. Smart contract, minting keys, and admin access all stay internal. Most secure, full control.

**Option B: Community contribution.** I contribute code as open-source. The team reviews, audits, and deploys. All contract ownership, minting keys, and admin access remain with the team. I have no privileged access — just a contributor submitting code for review.

**Option C: Collaborative.** We build together. I handle the eligibility engine and API logic, the team handles contract deployment, key management, and portal integration. All sensitive operations (minting, admin attestation) stay team-controlled.

**Regardless of approach, the team should always:**
- Deploy and own the smart contract
- Control the minter wallet private key
- Control admin attestation authority
- Review any code before it touches mainnet
- Have the ability to pause or upgrade without depending on anyone outside the team

The technical stack is straightforward — standard ERC-721, basic API server, Alchemy wallet reads. The hard part is the badge definitions and artwork. This proposal handles the definitions.

### Phases

**Phase 1 — Launch set** (20 badges, no game integration needed)
Deploy contract to Base. Eligibility engine reads Genesis/BitBeast/Physical Edition holdings. Badge wall goes live on the portal. Community goes live.

**Phase 2 — Full library + Beastside**
Add remaining trait badges, market behavior badges, community badges with admin attestation, cross-collection depth. B*Points integration. Beastside sends achievement events — game badges create the collecting-to-gaming loop.

**Phase 3 — Discord + automation**
`/badges` command in Discord for quick lookups. Webhook announcements for new badge unlocks. Weekly sweep auto-mints newly earned badges.

**Phase 4 — Ecosystem expansion**
Bisuto integration when it launches. Community badge proposals. Seasonal badges. XP tier perks. TGE snapshot readiness.

---

## Known Limitations

Being honest about what this system can and can't do:

**Badges are permanent, but holdings change.** You could earn Face Collector by holding all 4 premium balaclavas, then sell 3 and keep the badge. This is intentional — badges prove you *achieved* something, not that you *still have* it. Same model as Xbox achievements and Steam badges. The community will self-police obvious gaming.

**Multi-wallet problem.** If you hold Genesis on wallet A and BitBeast on wallet B, you won't earn Dual Citizen. Wallet linking (sign from both wallets to prove ownership) can solve this and could integrate with the portal's existing wallet connection.

**Market badges have limits.** Floor Sweeper can only be verified going forward since historical floor prices aren't stored. Some market badges are technically gameable through wash trading, but gas costs and marketplace fees are natural deterrents for badges that carry no monetary value.

**Community badges need clear criteria.** Admin-attested badges require someone to decide who qualifies. Criteria should be as objective as possible — "posted GM for 30 consecutive days" is verifiable from Discord logs, "consistently active" is subjective.

**XP thresholds need testing.** The tier thresholds in this proposal are initial estimates. Before launch, they should be simulated against real wallet data to get the right distribution across tiers.

## Questions for the Team

1. **Does this fit the vision?** Is a soulbound achievement layer something that makes sense for where AKCB is heading?
2. **Badge definitions**: Do these feel right for the community? What's missing, what's off?
3. **Artwork**: Community contest, commissioned, team-designed, or start with AI?
4. **B*Points integration**: Connect from day one, or launch independently and add hooks later?
5. **Portal integration**: What's the best way to add a badge wall to existing portal profiles?
6. **Beastside timeline**: When could the game send achievement events?
7. **Admin attestation**: Who verifies community/IRL badges — core team only, or trusted mods?
8. **Badge governance**: Can the community propose new badges, or team-controlled?
9. **Physical Edition**: Auto-qualify from holding the NFT, or require additional verification?
10. **Interest level**: Is this worth pursuing? What's the next step?
